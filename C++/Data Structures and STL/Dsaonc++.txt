Vectors - An Dynamic Array only supports adding elements to the right end

List - 

Stack - Pushing, Popping datas by using the LIFO(Last In First Out) Rule, also with Stack Top(Copies the top Element to the top, Stacking it)
Advantages of Stacks :
Simple to Implement:
 Stacks are straightforward to implement using arrays or linked lists.
 Efficient Data Access:
 Push, pop, and peek operations are executed in constant time, i.e., O(1).
 Memory Management:
 Stacks are widely used in memory allocation for managing the call stack, ensuring efficient execution of recursive functions and nested calls.
 Helps in Reversing Data:
 Stacks can easily reverse data sequences by pushing items into the stack and popping them out.
 Supports Recursive Programming:
 The call stack automatically manages function calls and return addresses.
 Versatile Applications:
 Stacks are essential in parsing expressions, syntax checking, balancing parentheses, and implementing algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS).
 Data Safety:
 With controlled access (only through the top), stacks help maintain the integrity of data.
